# React Documentation

## Learning Goals

- Build Familiarity with React's API and the 'Thinking in React' mindset
- Recognize the use for advanced React features

## Main Concepts

### Pre-check

Before reading the Main Concepts sections, try to write down your answers to the following questions. As you read, see whether your answers matched up to the documentation.

- How would you explain JSX to someone familiar with javascript, but not React?
- What are the stages in the React component lifecycle?
- When should data live in state, and when should it be passed in through props?

### Reading

Regardless of your level of experience with React, reading the documentation will further your understanding and deepen your skills. Take the time (it should be about an hour) to read through the [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html), building out the examples on CodePen (or on your own machine). Even if you have a familiarity with React, working through the basics will help locate and fill in hidden holes in your understanding.

### Post-check

After reading the Main Concepts, answer the following questions.

- What surprised you as you were reading the docs? What was new to you?
- What's the difference between Composition and Inheritance? Describe some situtations where you would use 'Composition'. Describe situations where you would use Inheritance.
- What's the difference between a controlled component and an uncontrolled component?
- What are 'keys' in React Elements, and what are they for?

## Advanced Guides

### Pre-check

Before reading React's Advanced Guides, you should check on what you already know.

First, for each of the topics mentioned, write out your current understanding of what that topic means. For topics that are total mysteries, write down your best guess for what that topic will be about.

```
Accessibility
Code-Splitting
Context
Error Boundaries
Forwarding Refs
Fragments
Higher-Order Components
Integrating with Other Libraries
JSX In Depth
Optimizing Performance
Portals
React Without ES6
React Without JSX
Reconciliation
Refs and the DOM
Render Props
Static Type Checking
Strict Mode
Typechecking With PropTypes
Uncontrolled Components
Web Components
```

### Reading

Read the [Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html) starting with the guide on Accessibility. Just like with the main concepts, take your time reading each one in its entirety, and make sure you run the sample code on CodePen or on your own machine. The Advanced Guides will take about 2 hours. They're dense, but chock full of terrific insights and solutions to the common problems web engineers face.

### Post-check

After reading, go back through your list of guesses for what the topics mean. Which ones did you get right? Which ones were off-base? Try to answer the following questions to check your understanding of the guides.

- What are 'refs'? When would you use them?
- What are 'Portals'? When would you use them?
- What would you do if you heard that a user of your React app was experiencing slowness on their page?
- What are 'render props'? What libraries have you used that use them?
- What are the differences between PropTypes and Static Type Checking? What would you use?
